Animations (off to on):
    • Checkmark mask (above Box light)
        ◦ This was implemented as a Bezier path, with a rectangle that is slightly
          taller than the checkmark and expands slowly from left to right to make
          the Checkmark slowly visible. This gives it the appearance of being drawn.

            ■ Width: ~2px (about half of the way from the left of the checkmark to the dip/angle in the mark)
